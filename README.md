# Image Recognition with ML
## Image Recognition with ML Part 1: MNIST Digit Classification
The first part of my exploration of image recognition using machine learing focuses on classifying handwritten digits, using the MNIST datase. The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (28x28 pixels). Models implemented in Part 1: **Logistic Regression**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Random Forest**, **Neural Network**. Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy comparison, confusion matrices for each model, and visualization of predicted and actual labels. Tools: Python, Numpy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, Tensorflow.
